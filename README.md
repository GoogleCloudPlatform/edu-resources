# Curated List of GCP educational resources

## Online Courses

* [Coursera GCP courses](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=gcp) Courses provided by both Google and other institutions that use GCP.  [Eligible faculty and students](https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/faqs/?modal_active=none) can get free access to 13 of the Google courses though the [Training Credits Program](https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/training/?modal_active=none).  
* [The Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) Originally, an on-line public version of the training for Google engineers, this has expanded to numerous classes including problem framing, data prep, and testing and debugging.  Students get hands-on experience using Colab. Along with the basic course, there are 5 specialized courses,  practica, guides, and a glossary.


## Books

### Available on-line
* [Mining of Massive Datasets](http://mmds.org/) by Jure Leskovec, Anand Rajaraman, Jeff Ullman.  A book to go with Stanford's 246 class.
* [Cloud Computing for Science and Engineering](https://cloud4scieng.org/) It's getting old (over 2 years), but has some useful background.  See the [Chapters tab](https://cloud4scieng.org/chapters/).

### Not available on-line
* [Data Science on Google Cloud Platform](http://amzn.com/B0787L7RK3) by Valliappa (Lak) Lakshmanan.  This book was distributed to attendees of SIGCSE 2019 and has been useful in a number of classes since then.


## Hands-on labs/tutorials

Codelabs and Qwiklabs are self-paced, hands-on tutorials.  Codelabs require students to have their own GCP account whereas Qwiklabs provide a new account for the student for each lab.  [Eligible faculty and students](https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/faqs/?modal_active=none) can get free access to Qwiklabs though the [Training Credits Program](https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/training/?modal_active=none).  

* [GCP codelabs](http://g.co/codelabs/cloud)
* [Other Google codelabs](http://g.co/codelabs)
* [Qwiklabs](http://google.qwiklabs.com)  Along with individual labs, Qwiklabs provides Quests, groupings of individual labs that make sense together.


## Notebooks
Jupyter notebooks are becoming extremely popular in many different classes, especially data science and machine learning.

* [Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com) A hosting platform for notebooks that provides access to GPUs and TPUs, with numerous instructional notebooks on how to use Colab.
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/kernels#notebooks) Kaggle provides hosting of Juptyer notebooks and so much more.  There are numerous public data sets, notebooks that provide [microcourses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) in numerous topics (such as Python, Machine Learning, and SQL) to help students, competitions, and the ability for faculty to run [their own competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/about/inclass/overview). 
* [AI Platform Notebooks](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-notebooks/) An enterprise notebook solution that interfaces quickly and easily with GCP tools such as BigQuery, Cloud Dataproc, and Cloud Dataflow.
* [Cloud Datalab](https://cloud.google.com/datalab/docs/how-to/working-with-notebooks) Another GCP tool to provide a notebook server.
* [Seedbank](https://research.google.com/seedbank/) A collection of interactive Machine Learning examples, designed to be used in Colab.


## General Resources

* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) A WWW site with [public data sets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), data science 
contests, [learning materials for numerous topics](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) 
(Python, Data science, ML, SQL, etc.), numerous tutorials (including 
[Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/eraaz1/a-comprehensive-guide-to-titanic-machine-learning) 
and MNIST), and sample solutions. Also allows faculty to run [their own contests in class](https://www.kaggle.com/about/inclass/overview).
* GCP hackathon toolkit (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/hackathon-toolkit) Variety of GCP resources for hackathons.


## Videos

* [GCP Essentials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIivdWyY5sqKh1gDR0WpP9iIOY00IE0xL) A 
series of 4 to 9 minute videos focusing on introductory level GCP, including topics such as 
compute options, serverless computing, machine learning, and data storage.  There are currently 8 videos, 
but they seems to add 1 per month.


## Grant Programs
GCP has a number of different grant programs, listed below.

* [GCP teaching grants](https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/teaching/)
* [GCP research grants](https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/research/)
* [QwikLabs credits](https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/training/)
* [Career readiness track](https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/career-readiness/)

Here's a quick comparison of those programs.

## Other public clouds
This repo is focused on GCP, but below are resources to consider when working with other public clouds.

* [Know AWS? Compare to GCP](https://cloud.google.com/docs/compare/aws/) &mdash; This section in the GCP documentation is for you if you're familiar with using AWS and want to discover the equivalent tools on GCP. There are also specific drilldowns found at the bottom should you want to get more product-level comparisons.
